# Uniswap Mobile

The home of the official Uniswap mobile app for iOS and Android!

## Development

### Setup

Follow the general [React Native setup instructions](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) with the following additional (optional) recommendations:

1. After installing Node: also install NVM to help you manage versions. Use the latest v14.x
2. Before installing cocoapods: install RBEnv and use it to install Ruby v3 globally. When installing cocoapods, follow the non-sudo instructions.

### Running

Start the mobile app by running `yarn ios` or `yarn android`. The JS bundler (metro) should automatically open in a new terminal window. If it does not, start it manually with `yarn start`.
